Collected tools for performance and capacity planning.

The "Estimating Performance Bounds" spreadsheet draws simplified
response time and throughput curves from an observed service time
and user think time, for a range of loads. It uses the operational
laws, so it doesn't require statistical assumptions, but it draws
them with sharp corners, while a benchmark or statistical model
would draw pretty curved corners.
